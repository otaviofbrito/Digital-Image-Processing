# Digital Image Processing 


## Contents

1. **[Component Counting Program](component_counter/README.md)**
    - This Python program counts the connected components in a given image.
    

2. **[Filtering Notebook](filtering.ipynb)**
    - This Jupyter notebook contains filtering operations on images.
    - Open the notebook in Jupyter to run the code cells and see the effects of different filters.

3. **[Intensity Operations Notebook](intensity.ipynb)**
    - This Jupyter notebook focuses on intensity transformations and operations on images.
    - Operations include various transformation functions, thresholding, contrast stretching, and intensity slicing.
    - Open the notebook in Jupyter to run the code cells and observe the changes in image intensity.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib` (for filtering and intensity operations)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digital-image-processing.git
    cd digital-image-processing
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
    ```

## Usage

1. **Component Counting**
    - Run the component counting program from the command line:
        ```bash
        python conta.py <image_path.pgm>
        ```
    - Replace `<image_path.pgm>` with the path to your image file in PGM format.

2. **Jupyter Notebooks**
    - Start Jupyter Notebook:
        ```bash
        jupyter notebook
        ```
    - Open `filtering.ipynb` or `intensity.ipynb` to explore filtering and intensity operations.
